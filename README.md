# WELCOME TO THE CAT WORLD

## A little tour in the hairy little beasts world

We all love our little beasts except the _allergic_ person.  
And we are all ready to do **everything** for them.

What to think about when you have a cat:
* feed it
* change it litter box
* pet it
* open the window


How to change the litter box:
1. take all the shit out of the box
2. put some new litter gravel
3. throw your cat through the window
4. your house is now cat free
